## **Design**

### Architecture

<img src="images/ArchitectureDiagram.png" width="450" />

The ***Architecture Diagram*** given above explains the high-level design of the App. Given below is a quick overview of each component.

**`Main`** has two classes called [`Main`](https://github.com/AY2021S1-CS2103T-W16-3/tp/blob/master/src/main/java/ay2021s1_cs2103_w16_3/finesse/Main.java) and [`MainApp`](https://github.com/AY2021S1-CS2103T-W16-3/tp/blob/master/src/main/java/ay2021s1_cs2103_w16_3/finesse/MainApp.java). It is responsible for:
* on app launch - initializing the components in the correct sequence, and connecting them to each other.
* on shut down - shutting down the components and invoking cleanup methods where necessary.

[**`Commons`**](#common-classes) represents a collection of classes used by multiple other components.

The rest of the App consists of four components.

* [**`UI`**](#ui-component): The App's User Interface.
* [**`Logic`**](#logic-component): The command executor.
* [**`Model`**](#model-component): Holds the data of the App in memory.
* [**`Storage`**](#storage-component): Reads data from, and writes data to, the hard disk.

Each of the four components:

* defines its *API* in an `interface` with the same name as the Component.
* exposes its functionality using a concrete `{Component Name}Manager` class (which implements the corresponding API `interface` mentioned in the previous point.

For example, the `Logic` component (see the class diagram given below) defines its API in the `Logic.java` interface and exposes its functionality using the `LogicManager.java` class which implements the `Logic` interface.

![Class Diagram of the Logic Component](images/LogicClassDiagram.png)

**How the architecture components interact with each other**

The *Sequence Diagram* below shows how the components interact with each other for the scenario where the user issues the command `delete 1`.

<img src="images/ArchitectureSequenceDiagram.png" width="574" />

The sections below give more details of each component.

### UI component

![Structure of the UI Component](images/UiClassDiagram.png)

**API** :
[`Ui.java`](https://github.com/AY2021S1-CS2103T-W16-3/tp/blob/master/src/main/java/ay2021s1_cs2103_w16_3/finesse/ui/Ui.java)

The UI consists of a `MainWindow` that is made up of parts e.g.`CommandBox`, `ResultDisplay`, `TransactionListPanel`, `StatusBarFooter` etc. All of these, including `MainWindow`, inherit from the abstract `UiPart` class.

The `UI` component uses the JavaFx UI framework. The layout of these UI parts is defined in matching `.fxml` files that are in the `src/main/resources/view` folder. For example, the layout of [`MainWindow`](https://github.com/AY2021S1-CS2103T-W16-3/tp/blob/master/src/main/java/ay2021s1_cs2103_w16_3/finesse/ui/MainWindow.java) is specified in [`MainWindow.fxml`](https://github.com/AY2021S1-CS2103T-W16-3/tp/blob/master/src/main/resources/view/MainWindow.fxml).

The `UI` component:

* executes user commands using the `Logic` component.
* listens for changes to `Model` data so that the UI can be updated with the modified data.

### Logic component

![Structure of the Logic Component](images/LogicClassDiagram.png)

**API** :
[`Logic.java`](https://github.com/AY2021S1-CS2103T-W16-3/tp/blob/master/src/main/java/ay2021s1_cs2103_w16_3/finesse/logic/Logic.java)

1. `Logic` uses the `FinanceTrackerParser` class to parse the user command.
1. This results in a `Command` object which is executed by `LogicManager`.
1. The command execution can affect `Model` (e.g. adding a transaction).
1. The result of the command execution is encapsulated as a `CommandResult` object which is passed back to `Ui`.
1. In addition, the `CommandResult` object can also instruct `Ui` to perform certain actions, such as displaying the help message to the user.

Below is the Sequence Diagram for interactions within the `Logic` component for the `execute("delete 1")` API call.

![Interactions Inside the Logic Component for the `delete 1` Command](images/DeleteSequenceDiagram.png)

<div markdown="span" class="alert alert-info">:information_source: **Note:** The lifeline for `DeleteCommandParser` should end at the destroy marker (X) but due to a limitation of PlantUML, the lifeline reaches the end of diagram.
</div>

### Model component

![Structure of the Model Component](images/ModelClassDiagram.png)

**API** : [`Model.java`](https://github.com/AY2021S1-CS2103T-W16-3/tp/blob/master/src/main/java/ay2021s1_cs2103_w16_3/finesse/model/Model.java)

The `Model`:

* stores a `UserPref` object that represents the user’s preferences.
* stores the finance tracker data in a `TransactionList` containing `Transaction`s.
* exposes `MonthlySavings` and `MonthlyBudget`, which can be 'observed' e.g. the UI can be bound to the values in these classes so that the UI automatically updates when the values in the classes change.
* exposes an unmodifiable `ObservableList<Transaction>` which can be 'observed' e.g. the UI can be bound to this list so that the UI automatically updates when the data in the list changes.
* does not depend on any of the other three components (`UI`, `Logic`, `Storage`).

A `Transaction`:
* represents a unit of user data within the finance tracker.
* is either an `Expense` or an `Income`.
* is composed of a `Title`, an `Amount`, a `Date`, and any number of `Category`s. These are known as *data fields*.

The *data fields* `Title`, `Amount`, `Date`, and `Category` are encapsulations of an underlying Java data type.

| Data Field  | Underlying Java Data Type   |
| ----------- | -------------------------   |
| `Title`     | `java.lang.String`          |
| `Amount`    | `java.math.BigDecimal`      |
| `Date`      | `java.time.LocalDate`       |
| `Category`  | `java.lang.String`          |

The underlying Java data types allow more operations to be done on `Transaction` objects, such as filtering `Transaction`s by `Date`, or aggregating the `Amount`s of `Expense`s and `Income`s.

<div markdown="span" class="alert alert-info">:information_source:
**Note:** All data fields take in a `String` in their constructor, regardless of the underlying Java data type.
Within the constructor, data validation takes place to ensure that the `String` correctly represents a valid data field.
If the `String` given is not valid, an `IllegalArgumentException` will be thrown.
Otherwise, the `String` is parsed into the underlying Java data type.<br><br>
The reason for this is that when a data field object needs to be created, it is generally from a `String`
(such as when a user command parsed from the `Logic` component, or when a transaction is loaded from the `Storage` component).
This abstraction is maintained so that the implementation of other components (`Logic` and `Storage`) is independent of
the underlying Java data type choices in the `Model` component.
</div>

The `FinanceTracker` has a `TransactionList` field which stores all `Expense` and `Income` objects together.

The `ModelManager` has three `FilteredList` fields which point to the same `ObservableList` obtained from `FinanceTracker::getTransactionList`.
The `Predicate` fields in the three `FilteredList` fields are set such that:
* `filteredTransactions` shows a view of all `Transaction` objects
* `filteredExpenses` shows a view of all `Transaction` objects of type `Expense`
* `filteredIncomes` shows a view of all `Transaction` objects of type `Income`

The motivation behind having three lists is due to the fact that there are three tabs in the user interface, each having its own list while at the same time retrieving data from the same transaction list.

### Storage component

![Structure of the Storage Component](images/StorageClassDiagram.png)

**API** : [`Storage.java`](https://github.com/AY2021S1-CS2103T-W16-3/tp/blob/master/src/main/java/ay2021s1_cs2103_w16_3/finesse/storage/Storage.java)

The `Storage` component:

* can save `UserPref` objects in `JSON` format and read it back.
* can save the finance tracker data in `JSON` format and read it back.

`JsonAdaptedExpense` and `JsonAdaptedIncome` are `JSON`-friendly adaptations of `Expense` and `Income` respectively.
However, unlike `Expense` and `Income`, all the fields in `JsonAdaptedExpense` and `JsonAdaptedIncome` are `String` objects.
This is so that the fields are compatible with the `JSON` format.

`JsonSerializableFinanceTracker` contains two `List` fields, one containing all `JsonAdaptedExpense` objects and the other containing all `JsonAdaptedIncome` objects.
Despite the similarities between `Expense` and `Income`, and despite the fact that objects of both types are put into the same list in `FinanceTracker`,
the motivation behind keeping them separately is to ensure that they are separately listed in the `JSON` data file.

### Common classes

Classes used by multiple components are in the `ay2021s1_cs2103_w16_3.finesse.commons` package.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

## **Implementation**

This section describes some noteworthy details on how certain features are implemented.

### Find transactions

The find transactions feature is implemented via `FindCommandParser`, as well as the following commands:

* `FindCommand`, the base command that is returned when the command is parsed
* `FindTransactionCommand`, to be executed when the user inputs the command on the Overview tab
* `FindExpenseCommand`, to be executed when the user inputs the command on the Expenses tab
* `FindIncomeCommand`, to be executed when the user inputs the command on the Incomes tab

`FindCommandParser` takes in the command arguments and parses them to return a `FindCommand` containing the correct predicate for finding the transactions.
Depending on the UI tab the user inputted the command in, a `FindXXXCommand` (`FindTransactionCommand`, `FindExpenseCommand` or `FindIncomeCommand`) will be created from the base `FindCommand`.
When executed, the `FindXXXCommand` will set the predicate of the respective `FilteredList` in `ModelManager` so that only the transactions matching the keywords will be displayed in the list.

Below is the Sequence Diagram for interactions within the `Logic` and `Model` components when the user inputs the `"find tea"` command while on the Overview tab.

![Interactions Inside the Logic Component for the `find tea` Command on the Overview tab](images/FindSequenceDiagram.png)

Alternatives considered:

* Having separate command parsers for each tab in which the find command can be input, e.g. `FindTransactionCommandParser`, `FindExpenseCommandParser` and `FindIncomeCommandParser`.

### Programmatically switch selected tab

Several of the expense/income-specific commands update the list of transactions displayed in a particular tab.
Examples of these include the `add-expense` and `add-income` commands.
As such, on the execution of such commands, the UI has to switch to the affected tab to display the result of the command execution.

The ability to programmatically update the selected tab is implemented via `CommandResult`.
Upon the successful execution of a command, a `CommandResult` is generated and passed back to `MainWindow`.
This `CommandResult` contains the necessary information which the `MainWindow` needs to update the user interface, such as:
* The feedback to be displayed to the user;
* Whether to exit the application; and
* Whether to programmatically switch to a different tab in the user interface.

![Interactions inside the Logic Component when executing commands](images/CommandResultSequenceDiagram.png)

Alternatives considered:

* Add a method in `MainWindow` which can be called to programmatically switch tabs in the user interface upon execution of the command.
  This was decided against as it would result in a much tighter coupling of `Logic` and `UI` components.

### Set monthly spending limit

The monthly budgeting feature is implemented via `SetExpenseLimitCommand` as well as `MonthlyExpenseLimit`.

[Coming soon]

### Set monthly savings goal

The monthly budgeting feature is implemented via `SetSavingsGoalCommand` as well as `MonthlySavingsGoal`.

[Coming soon]

### [Proposed] Frequent Expense Feature

#### Proposed Implementation
The Frequent Expense feature consists of `add-frequent-expense`, `edit-frequent-expense`, `delete-frequent-expense`,
`convert-frequent-expense`.

Frequent expenses are expenses that the user have identified to be occurring regularly or with high frequency.
Examples of such expenses can be phone bill, music subscription or buying bubble tea on a weekly basis.

This feature allows users to add frequent expenses to the finance tracker. The user can then choose to convert a
frequent expense to an expense that the user wants to add to the transaction list in the finance tracker. This is done by
calling `Logic#execute` which creates an  `AddFrequentExpenseCommand`. This command then calls
`ModelManager#addFrequentExpense`, adding the specified frequent expense into the frequent expense list.

This feature also simplifies the deletion and editing of frequent expenses, and they work in a similar manner.

#### Convert Frequent Expense To Expense Feature

The purpose of this feature is to allow users to add expenses, that they add to the transaction list in the finance
tracker on a frequent basis in a convenient manner. After adding a frequent expense into the frequent expense list in
the finance tracker, the user can call convert-frequent-expense to the respective frequent expense to make the
conversion.

Given below is the proposed UML sequence diagram and explanation of an example usage scenario for
convert-frequent-expense

![Sequence Diagram of the Convert Frequent Expense To Expense Feature](images/ConvertFrequentExpenseSequenceDiagram.png)

1. User enters the command `convert-frequent-expense 1 d/05/05/2020`, where `1` is the index of the respective frequent
expense in the frequent expense list and `d/05/05/20` is the date on which the user wants to carry out the conversion,
to add the selected frequent expense into the expense list. This command is executed by `LogicManager`, which will then
call `FinanceTrackerParser#parseCommand(“convert-frequent-expense 1 d/05/05/2020”)`. This will create a
`ConvertFrequentExpenseCommand` object and return it to the `LogicManager`.
2. The `LogicManager` will then call `ConvertFrequentExpenseCommand#execute`, which will call
`Model#getFilteredFrequentExpenseList()` to retrieve the list of frequent expenses in the finance tracker.
3. The program will then retrieve the specified frequent expense from the list of frequent expenses. It will
then call `FrequentExpense#convert` on the frequent expense together with the date the user has inputted and convert
it to an `Expense` object.
4. After converting the `FrequentExpense` object to an `Expense` object, it will call `Model#addExpense` to add the
`Expense` object to the expense list in the finance tracker.
