<div markdown="block" class="alert alert-info">

**:information_source: &nbsp; Notes about the command format:**<br>

* Words in `UPPER_CASE` are the parameters to be supplied by the user.<br>
  e.g. in `add-expense t/TITLE`, `TITLE` is a parameter which can be used as `add t/Bubble Tea`.

* Items in square brackets (`[]`) are optional.<br>
  e.g `t/TITLE [c/CATEGORY]` can be used as `t/Bubble Tea c/Food & Beverage` or as `t/Bubble Tea`.

* Items in square brackets, with `...` after the parameter, can be used multiple times (including zero times).<br>
  e.g. `[c/CATEGORY...]` can be used as `c/Food & Beverage`, `c/Food & Beverage c/Tea` etc, or even omitted completely.

* Parameters can be in any order.<br>
  e.g. if the command specifies `t/TITLE a/AMOUNT`, `a/AMOUNT t/TITLE` is also acceptable.

</div>

<div markdown="block" class="alert alert-info">

**:warning: &nbsp; IMPORTANT &nbsp; :warning:**<br>

The formats of the parameters used in the rest of the document are as follows:
* `TITLE` and `CATEGORY` should consist of printable ASCII characters, and cannot begin with a space.
  * The set of printable ASCII characters consists of alphanumeric characters, space, and several special characters.
    Below is an exhaustive list of printable ASCII characters (excluding line breaks):
  ```
0123456789ABCDEFGHIJKLMNOPQRSTUVWXYZabcdefghijkl
mnopqrstuvwxyz !"#$%&'()*+,-./:;<=>?@[\]^_`{|}~
  ```
* `AMOUNT`, `AMOUNT_FROM` and `AMOUNT_TO` should be non-negative numbers up to 8 digits with 0 or 2 decimal places, with an optional `$` in front.
* `DATE`, `DATE_FROM` and `DATE_TO` should be a valid calendar date in `dd/mm/yyyy` format, representing day, month, and year respectively.
  * Valid ranges for days and months are governed by the rules of the [Gregorian Calendar](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gregorian_calendar#Description).

    * Days should only range from 1 to 28, 29, 30, or 31 (all inclusive),
    depending on the number of days in the given month and whether the given year is a leap year.
  * For day and month values, single-digit values must be padded with leading zeroes, meaning that a value of 5 should be written as `05` instead of `5`.
  * For year values, it must be written in the standard 4-digit format, so 2019 should be written as `2019` and not just `19`.
  * Dates cannot be earlier than 1 January 1970 (`01/01/1970`).
